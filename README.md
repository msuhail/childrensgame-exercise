# childrensgame-exercise
A coding exercise.

# Consider the following children's game:
• ’n’ children stand around a circle. \n
• Starting with a given child and working clockwise, each child gets a sequential number, which we will refer to as the child’s ‘id’
• Then starting with the first child, they count from 1 until ‘k’, where ‘k’ is determined at the start of the game. The child who counts ‘k’ is now out and leaves the circle. The count starts again with the child immediately next to the eliminated one.
• Children are so removed from the circle one by one. The winner is the child left standing last.
Write a static method on a new class, which, when given ’n’ and ‘k’, returns the sequence of children as they go out, and the id of the winning child. Create any additional classes you need to support the design of your solution and also a unit test harness.

# And while you are at it...
• Use as little memory as possible and make the method as fast a possible.
• In your comments, discuss the runtime order complexity (i.e 0(n) or 0(n^2) or ....) of the program.
• Design your class(s) so that it can be used in any environment.
